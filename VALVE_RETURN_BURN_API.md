# Valve Return and Burn API Documentation

## Overview

The Valve Return and Burn API provides functionality for managing valve returns, token burning, and ownership restoration in the ValveChain ecosystem. This API supports the complete workflow from return request creation to admin approval and final burn/restore operations.

## Key Features

- **Return Request Management**: Create and track valve return requests
- **Admin Approval Workflow**: Requires administrator approval for all burn/restore operations
- **Token Burning**: Permanently remove tokens for damaged or non-resellable valves
- **Ownership Restoration**: Restore ownership for valves that can be resold
- **Return Fee Processing**: Support for negotiated return fees with 0.5% transaction fees
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All operations are logged with reasons and outcomes

## Authentication

All endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

Admin-only operations require users with `role: 'admin'`.

## Transaction Fees

All return and burn operations include a **0.5% transaction fee** that is automatically calculated and transferred to the organization's fee wallet. The fee is calculated on the total transaction amount (including any return fees).

**Fee Calculation:**

- Fee Amount = (Transaction Amount + Return Fee) Ã— 0.005
- Fee Wallet: Configurable via `FEE_WALLET_ADDRESS` environment variable

## Audit Logging

All operations are automatically logged to the audit trail with:

- Success/failure status

Audit logs can be accessed via the existing `/api/audit_logs` endpoint (admin only).
